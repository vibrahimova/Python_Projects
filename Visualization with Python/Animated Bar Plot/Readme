***In this repo, I share how to create a bar chart race animation such as the one below using the matplotlib data visualization library in python.*** 

A bar chart race is an animated sequence of bars that show data values at different moments in time. 
The bars re-position themselves at each time period so that they remain in order (either ascending or descending).
